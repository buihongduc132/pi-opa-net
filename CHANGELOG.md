## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **GROUP I — pulumi IaC safety** (4 rules): `block-pulumi-up-force` (`up --force`/`-y`/`--yes`/`--skip-preview`), `block-pulumi-destroy`, `block-pulumi-stack-rm`, `block-pulumi-state-delete` (delete/unprotect). `pulumi` added to SUBCOMMAND_PROGRAMS in both parsers. Read-only ops (`preview`, `stack ls`) stay allowed.
- **GROUP J — DevOps destructive-CLI coverage** (27 rules): terraform/tofu/terragrunt (destroy, `apply -auto-approve`, `state rm/delete`, `terragrunt run destroy/apply --auto-approve`), nomad (job stop/deregister, alloc stop/signal/restart, system gc, node drain, deployment fail/pause, volume detach), consul (kv delete, services deregister, leave/force-leave, operator raft remove-peer), vault (kv delete/destroy, secrets/auth disable, token/lease revoke, seal, operator raft remove-peer), aws (multiword destructive verbs + `s3 rm`/`rb` two-token guard), pm2 (kill/delete/stop/restart), systemctl (stop/kill/mask/disable/isolate), dd (`of=/dev/*` block-device writes), and **docker-compose v1 standalone binary GROUP C parity** (litellm carve-out bypass closed).
- **8 new rule families**: `pulumi`, `iac`, `nomad`, `consul`, `vault`, `aws`, `svcman`, `dd` — RuleFamily union + decision-output.v1.json enum kept in sync.
- **Parser canary tests**: `pulumiParsing.test.ts`, `groupJParsing.test.ts` — pin subcommand-shape classification so GROUP I/J rules cannot silently stop firing on parser drift.

### Fixed

- **Worktree path signal took LAST positional instead of git path-first grammar.** `git worktree add .worktrees/foo HEAD` was wrongly denied (ref `HEAD` extracted as target path). Now picks the path-LIKE positional (contains `/` or starts with `.`/`~`); `move` keeps last (new-path), `repair` takes first. Regression tests added.
- **`SignalCollector.collect()` typed `any` → `object`** (root-cause lint fix, no behavior change).
- Repo-wide biome format pass (lint:ci 17 → 0 errors).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **herdr session protection rules** — 4 new rules blocking destructive herdr commands: `block-herdr-server-stop`, `block-herdr-session-stop`, `block-herdr-session-delete`, `block-herdr-workspace-close`. Extends `session_kill_targets` in the rego policy to include `herdr` and `bermuda` (herdr plugin daemon), so `pkill herdr` / `killall bermuda` are also blocked. Herdr is a terminal workspace manager for AI coding agents; killing it destroys active workspaces, sessions, and agent state.
- **`pi_opa_net_version` in all audit traces** — every decision metadata and audit log entry (filesystem JSONL + OTLP export) now carries the exact pi-opa-net package version. Enables after-the-fact version correlation when debugging decision trails. New `src/version.ts` reads the version from package.json once at module load.
- **`PIOPANET_DRY_RUN` safety mode** — setting `PIOPANET_DRY_RUN=1` adds a `dry_run: true` marker to decision metadata. Tests and CI set this flag to guarantee the CLI is in evaluation-only mode (no command execution). E2E tests now run with this flag enabled.

### Fixed

- **pi-session smoke test: init git repo in temp cwd.** Pi requires a `.git` directory to start; the test now runs `git init` in the temp dir so the session can launch. Previously pi refused to start with "not a git repo".
- **pi-session smoke test: opt-in only.** These tests spawn a real pi session using the DEPLOYED pi-opa-net, not local source. They now skip by default and run explicitly with `PIOPANET_RUN_PI_SMOKE=1` after deploy.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: A4 self-check crashed pi at extension load time.** `src/pi/runtime-self-check.ts` used `import.meta.dir` (Bun-only API) to compute `REPO_ROOT`. Pi's extension loader uses jiti under Node.js where `import.meta.dir` is `undefined`, causing `path.resolve(undefined, ...)` → `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined`. The bug was latent in 0.4.1 (A4 never deployed before 0.4.1) and surfaced immediately after publish. Replaced with the portable `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` + `dirname()` pattern. Tests pass under both Bun and Node/jiti.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Reconciled deployed 0.4.0 ghost into repo main.** The deployed production copy (`~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-opa-net/`) contained unpublished features (OTLP/HTTP audit sink, MultiSink fan-out, config-driven audit factory, `rm -rf` dangerous-target policy) that had never been committed to git. This release brings the repo source in sync with the deployed binary while preserving the A4 runtime self-check layer (which was inadvertently lost in the unpublished 0.4.0 ghost).
- **`block-rm-rf-dangerous-target` rule** — blocks `rm -rf` on dangerous targets (`/`, `~`, `.`, `..`, `*`, `/*`, `$HOME`, `/home`). Safe carve-outs preserved: `/tmp/<specific>`, `./<specific>`, named dirs. Rule uses both `args`-based matching AND `raw`-regex fallback (shell-quote expands globs/env-vars away from args).

### Fixed

- **A4 regression restored** — deployed 0.4.0 had silently dropped `markHookRegistered()` and `src/pi/runtime-self-check.ts`; repo main now retains the A4 prevention layer.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Layer A4 — runtime self-check** (`src/pi/runtime-self-check.ts`): `runSelfCheck()` verifies at startup that (a) the `tool_call` hook was registered, (b) `package.json` declares a non-empty `pi.extensions`, and (c) the first extension entry default-exports a function. Catches a C1-class regression (missing manifest) at startup instead of at deploy-time. Exports `runSelfCheck()`, `markHookRegistered()`, `isHookRegistered()`. The extension loader (`src/pi/index.ts`) now calls `markHookRegistered()` immediately after `registerToolCallEvent(pi)`.
- **Layer A3 — CLI contract tests** (`tests/e2e/cli-contract.test.ts`): guards the C2-class bug (compound-command parsing) at the CLI boundary. Covers both env-prefix+semicolon (`export FOO=bar; <cmd>`) and plain commands; deny cases (`git stash pop`, `git reset --hard`) and allow cases (`git status`, `ls -la`). Skips gracefully if OPA or bun is missing.
- **Layer A1 — pi-session E2E smoke gate** (`tests/e2e/pi-session-smoke.test.ts`): release gate that spawns live `pi -p` sessions to confirm real-world blocking behavior. Verifies `git stash pop` / `git reset --hard HEAD` produce BLOCKED output and `git status` does not. Skips via `PIOPANET_SKIP_PI_SMOKE=1` or when `pi` is not on PATH.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-23


### Fixed

- CRITICAL: compound commands (e.g. `export FOO=bar; git stash pop`) now have EACH segment evaluated against the OPA policy. Previously the parser only saw the first command (`export`), which is always allowed, so dangerous commands after `;` were silently evaluated. This was the root cause of pi-opa-net appearing to never block commands in live pi sessions (pi-bash-guard prepends env exports to every command).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- CRITICAL: declared `pi.extensions` in package.json so pi-coding-agent's extension loader can discover the `tool_call` hook. Without this, the entire safety guard was a silent no-op (extension loaded but hook never registered).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Capability-based unlock-keys** (`src/unlock/`) — trusted agents present a per-rule salted HMAC key (long-lived `ll_<16hex>` or TTL `ttl.<exp>.<16hex>`); the TS-side post-eval filter demotes matching deny reasons. Schema stays v1 (additive). Policy file `safety.rego` is unchanged.
- **`unlock-key` CLI subcommand** — `pi-opa-net unlock-key <rule_id> [--ttl <sec>]` mints keys; `--list` enumerates catalog rule_ids. Refuses unknown rule_ids and the god-key `PIOPANET_UNLOCK_ALL`.
- **Three delivery channels** — `PIOPANET_UNLOCK_KEYS` env (comma-separated), `--unlock <key>` (repeatable), `--unlock-stdin` (requires positional command arg).
- **Salt seam** (`SaltResolver`) — deploy-local `~/.pi-opa-net/salt` with auto-gen (atomic `wx`, mode 0o600), env override (`PIOPANET_UNLOCK_SALT` literal, `PIOPANET_UNLOCK_SALT_FILE` path), warn on world-readable. Interface for future remote/keychain resolver.
- **Audit seam** (`AuditSink` + `NoOpSink`) — decision record is the sole audit surface in v1. Interface for future `FileAppendSink`/`WebhookSink`.
- **All-or-nothing multi-rule semantics** — allow ⟺ every `severity:block` reason has a matching valid key. Partial bypass forbidden; `metadata.unlock_blocked_count` records remaining blockers.
- **Three new schema sources** — `'opa-unlocked'` (legitimate bypass), `'fail-open-keyless'` (OPA down + keys present, auditable degradation), `'unlock-filter-error'` (filter crash falls back to un-filtered decision, never allows-by-accident).
- **Cache poisoning guard** — when unlock keys present, `cacheTtlMs` forced to 0 regardless of `PI_OPA_CACHE_TTL_MS`.
- **Decision-output.v1 schema (additive)** — `reasons[]` gains optional `bypassed`, `unlock_key_id` (first 8 hex only — full key NEVER logged), `unlock_key_type`, `unlock_expires_at`, `unlock_status`; `metadata` gains `unlock_count`, `unlock_blocked_count`, `unlock_agent`. `additionalProperties:false` preserved everywhere.
- **OpenSpec change** at `openspec/changes/rule-unlock-keys/` — proposal, design (D1–D11), spec (REQ-001..018 + 9 scenarios), tasks.
- **109 new tests** (304 total pass) covering key derivation, parser, verifier, filter, salt resolver, audit sink, decision builder integration, CLI, schema, and e2e flow. Typecheck + lint clean.

### Decisions (locked, immutable)

- **LD-L1**: per-rule granularity (one rule = one key, no per-command)
- **LD-L2**: no god-key (refuse `PIOPANET_UNLOCK_ALL`)
- **LD-L3**: two lifetimes (LL + TTL) via self-describing prefix
- **LD-L4**: delivery = ENV + `--unlock` + `--unlock-stdin`
- **LD-L6**: TS-side post-eval filter (keys never enter OPA input/trace)
- **LD-Y1/Y2**: deploy-local salt + NoOp audit (YAGNI seams for future)
- **LD-G1**: fail-open+keys → `source:fail-open-keyless`
- **LD-G2**: `--unlock-stdin` requires positional command
- **LD-G3**: `cacheTtlMs` forced 0 when keys present
- **LD-G6**: all-or-nothing multi-rule semantics
- **LD-G8**: filter crash → fall back to un-filtered decision

### Verifier-loop

- Pre-merge: jewilo 2/2 APPROVE, hash `072026-c604475a` (fullDigest `c604475a...`).
- Post-merge: jewilo-dev with rag-quick model 2/2 APPROVE, hash `072026-7291243b`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Cupcake-compatible policy** (`.cupcake/policies/claude/cc_safety_net_parity.rego`) that ports all 42 active `cc-safety-net` user rules into OPA/Rego v1 with the Cupcake custom-policy structure: `# METADATA`, `package cupcake.policies.cc_safety_net_parity`, `import rego.v1`, and mandatory self-filtering. The aggregation entrypoint `data.cupcake.system.evaluate` is provided in `.cupcake/system/evaluate.rego`.
- **Rulebook fixture** at `tests/fixtures/user-rules.rulebook.json` and a new `tests/cupcake/cc_safety_net_parity.test.ts` suite that runs all 53 rulebook `tests[]` fixtures + 12 tmux/pkill/killall scenarios + self-filtering checks.
- **4 missing tmux/pkill/killall rules** to the pi-opa-net engine (`policy/safety.rego`, `src/rules/catalog.ts`) for full 42-rule parity with the active `cc-safety-net` rulebook.
- **DecisionBuilder disambiguation** for rules that share identical reason text (the tmux session-kill family): the registry now maps `(message, family)` to rule metadata when a raw deny carries a `family` hint, falling back to the previous message-only lookup.
- **Documentation**: `docs/cupcake-parity.md` describing the Cupcake policy and standalone `opa eval` usage; README updated to reflect the 42-rule catalog and the new policy file.
## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **decision-output.v1 schema** — JSON Schema draft 2020-12, strict (`additionalProperties: false`). Symmetric allow + deny output with rule provenance, fail-mode observability, and parse-confidence surfacing. 4 canonical examples, all validated by a hard test gate.
- **OPA decision engine** (`OpaCliEngine`) — subprocess `opa eval` with temp-file input, fail-open/fail-closed branching, SHA-256 rulebook digest for drift detection.
- **Hybrid command parser** — `ShellQuoteParser` (AST primary) + `RegexFallbackParser` (fallback), coordinated via `CommandParserCoordinator`. Program-aware subcommand classification (git/docker/gh/glab subcommand-style; rm/bd/gcloud/bq args-only).
- **Rule registry + 37-rule catalog** mirroring `policy/safety.rego` message-for-message. A bidirectional parity test enforces zero drift between rego and the TS catalog.
- **CLI** (`pi-opa-net eval`) — claude-code mode (suppress allow stdout) and `--json` mode (always emit schema). Exit codes `0 = allow`, `2 = deny` (Claude Code hook protocol compatible). Reads from args or stdin.
- **Rego policy** (`policy/safety.rego`) — covers git, docker, docker-compose carve-outs, rm, gh, glab, gcloud, bq, bd families. Native bare-default handling (`git stash` ≡ push).
- **Env-driven config** — `PI_OPA_FAIL_MODE`, `PI_OPA_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PI_OPA_BINARY` (mise-aware discovery), `PI_OPA_HOSTNAME`, `PI_OPA_SESSION_ID`.
- **Decision-design docs** — `docs/locked-decisions.yaml` (LD1–LD5), `docs/open-threads.yaml` (OT1–OT5, all resolved with rationale).
- **CI** — GitHub Actions workflow (typecheck + lint + test + coverage on ubuntu/macos).
- **Skill doc** — `skills/pi-opa-net/SKILL.md` for pi agent discovery.

### Resolved design threads

- **OT1 (parser)** — hybrid: AST primary, regex fallback; `parse_confidence` surfaces path per-decision.
- **OT2 (fail-mode)** — fail-open default (matches pi-safety-net fork), configurable to fail-closed.
- **OT3 (bare git stash)** — handled natively in rego (`subcommand == "stash" && count(args) == 0`).
- **OT4 (fork disposition)** — pi-safety-net kept as Path A (non-pi agents); pi-opa-net is Path B (OPA-backed).
- **OT5 (pi extension wiring)** — deferred to a separate `pi-opa-net-ext` repo; this package exposes the engine + library + CLI.

### Tests

- 106 tests across 10 files (unit + e2e + schema gate).
- Line coverage 98.89%, function coverage 88.98%.
- E2E runs the live CLI against real OPA 1.18.1 — 20 distinct deny rules fire (≥40% of the 37-rule catalog) plus 5 allow carve-outs and fail-open/fail-closed paths.
